        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
        <p>

        </p>
        Former Soviet Eastern European countries and satellite states still suffer economic inequality and low quality of life to this day. Due to this, citizens of these countries seek migration to other countries for a chance at a better life. The European Union gives these citizens the opportunity to migrate to any other country within the EU. Poland is a former Soviet satellite state where these issues are prominent so many of it's citizens have migrated since joining the EU in 2004. While this provides more opportunities for these Polish migrants to to make a higher yearly wage and live in better conditions it is contributing to the rapid decline of population in Poland. This makes Poland the fastest aging population of any other European contry and contributes greatly to a more rapid decline in the country's economy.

        <p>
<li><i>1. Map Purpose:</i> The purpose of the map is to show the migration of Polish born people since joining the European Union in 2004. This map is intended for viewers outside of Poland to see the yearly decline in citizens wanting to remain in the country. I hope to learn which EU countries most Polish born migrants reside in. I'm hoping that patterns form based on the average income and cost of living in those countries. I'm hoping to have an interactive map where viewers can specifically see the number of Polish migrants in each country as well as the year they arrived, the median income of the country, and the average cost of living.</li>
        
        
        
<li><i>2. Map Structure:</i> I want to include all 27 countries that are currently members of the European Union. I would like to create a choropleth map with graduated colors that represent Polish population density in the countries. Suplementary data will be provided to the viwers through ancillary text that way when they click on a country they can see three levels of data provided. The data provided in the ancillary elements will be Polish emigration volume total, median income, and average cost of living index.</li>
        
        
        
<li><i>3. Data Sources:</i> The data on Polish emigration will come directly from Poland's government website. Through there I was able to find an excel spreadsheet that displays the immigration and emigration to and from Poland to every country from 1966 to 2018. Since Numbeo is the largest database in the world for displaying cost of living and is so widely accepted I decided it was my best source for displaying the cost of living in each country. For median income I am using WorldData.info because nearly all of the data used is from World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and OECD. I can also display all of the information in the form of USD that way there is only one currency being used on my map making understanding the information much easier for the viewer. All of the data is scaled by country. Median income is based per person and not per household since my data on polish emigration is based on individual people and not families. The information on emigration from Poland was published in 2019 by the Polish government, the data I'm using from Numbeo up to data but I can select each year I want (2018), and the data from WorldData.info is up to date.</li>
        
        <ul>
            <li>stat.gov.pl</li>
            <li>worlddata.info</li>
            <li>numbeo.com</li>
        </ul>
        
        
<li><i>4. Methodology:</i> The preprocessing of my data will begin with me creating an excel spread sheet and putting all of the EU countries in the first column and different rows, I will then create three more columns that display Polish immigration (2004-2018), median salary, and average cost of living index. I will then put the data I collected from each source in its appropriate column and row. After the data has all been put into one place I will use ArcGIS and place a layer over the basemap that only displays EU countries after that I need to create three more layers that display Polish immigration (2004-2018), median salary, and average cost of living index. From there I can create classifications based on the data to create a choropleth map with graduated colors.</li>
